So, for this game we need to have two canons that are simultaniously protecting their base (located behind them) 
while trying to destroy the opposing base.
In addition to the incoming fire from the other player there will be soldiers spawning from the ememy base 
that will damage the players base should they reach it.
At random intervals bonuses will spawn that will help the player who shoots them first.

Breakdown:

Canons
We will need to code it so the canons can move up and down within a set space.
We will need to code it so that the canons can fire at a certain rate of fire.
We will need to code it so that canons can block incomming fire to a point.
We will need to code it so that canos explode if taking too much fire and respawn after a few seconds.

Base
We will need to code it so the base has a set visable health.
We will need to code it so the base loses health when a shot collides with it.
We will need to code it so the base loses health when a soldier collides with it.
We will need to code it so that soldiers can spawn from the base.

Soldiers
We will need to code it so that soldiers hit by enemy shots are destroyed.

Bonuses
We will need to code a bonus that restores health to the base
We will need to code a bonus that increases the canon's rate of fire for a set time.
We will need to code a bonus that that makes a players soldiers take two shots to destroy for a short time.
We will need to code a bonus that destroy the enemy players canon.
Others will be fun...
